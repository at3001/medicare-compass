            <p class="AboutPara">Medicare Compass is an educational website designed to support immigrants on their Medicare journey. Below is a peek into our process of how we brought the idea to life.

            <h2 class="AboutSubtext">The problem</h2>
            <p class="AboutPara">
                The idea for Medicare Compass came out of a desire to support our loved ones in an increasingly important aspect of their lives: managing their health into old age. As a team of immigrants and children of immigrants, we have seen firsthand the challenges of navigating a new country with few existing connections and an abundance of language and cultural barriers. Layer on the notoriously complex and expensive US healthcare system, a system that even native-born Americans have difficulty navigating, and the challenge feels insurmountable.

Though Lillyâ€™s mom had the time and resources to piece together an informed decision, we knew many immigrants are not so fortunate and fall trap to lifetime penalties, denial of coverage, and unaffordable medical bills.

                Our first step in our design process was to interview five other immigrants who had recently gone through the Medicare enrollment process. We noticed the following recurring pain points:

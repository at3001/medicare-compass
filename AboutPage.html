            <h1 class="titleText">Designing for our loved ones</h1>
            <p class="AboutPara">Medicare Compass is an educational website designed to support immigrants on their Medicare journey. Below is a peek into how we brought the idea to life!
            </p>
            <h2 class="AboutSubtext">The problem</h2>
            <p class="AboutPara">
                The idea for Medicare Compass came out of a desire to support our loved ones in an increasingly important aspect of their lives: managing their health into old age. As a team of immigrants and children of immigrants, we have seen firsthand the challenges of navigating a new country with few existing connections and an abundance of language and cultural barriers. Layer on the notoriously complex and expensive US healthcare system, a system that even native-born Americans have difficulty navigating, and the challenge feels insurmountable. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="AboutPara">
                This problem shows itself in the statistics. Immigrants are more likely to be uninsured, have no usual source of care other than the emergency room, and to skip or postpone care in the last 12 months compared to naturalized citizens<a href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/fact-sheet/key-facts-on-health-coverage-of-immigrants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">¹</a>. The idea of tackling Medicare enrollment came to mind after Lilly saw her mom, a 64-year old Chinese immigrant, attend 40 hours of webinar classes, meet with three insurance agents, and call several of her friends to try to determine which Medicare plan she should choose. Though Lilly’s mom had the time and resources to piece together an informed decision, we knew many immigrants are not so fortunate and fall trap to lifetime penalties, denial of coverage, and unaffordable medical bills.

            <p class="AboutPara">
                Our first step in our design process was to interview five other immigrants who had recently gone through the Medicare enrollment process. We noticed the following recurring pain points:

            <h3 class="AboutSubtext2">Lack of guidance</h3>
            <p class="AboutPara">
                When asked how they went about starting to learn about Medicare, almost all interviewees described a feeling of “I didn’t even know where to begin.” Most interviewees were used to choosing from the 1-3 health insurance plans their employers offered, rather than comparing the dozens of different pathways you can take with Medicare coverage. Due to lack of connections in the US, interviewees had not seen older family members go through Medicare enrollment and had no idea what to expect or what questions to ask.

                Most interviewees cited Google as one of their first information sources for Medicare, and recounted being overwhelmed by the number of search results that would appear. Though Google offered information on almost any question they asked, each question required a painstaking amount of time in order to piece together a cohesive answer. Interviewees desired a single source of truth that was capable of addressing their specific situation, without forcing them to sift through dozens of articles to find what they needed.

            <p class="AboutPara">
                Even for interviewees with high English proficiency, reading about Medicare outside their native tongue is exhausting and time consuming. For the few resources that do exist in their native language, interviewees had difficulty applying their learnings later on as they had trouble recognizing the terms in English. Outside of language, some interviewees expressed frustration with the UI of Medicare articles and Google results in general, such as the font being too small for an older person to read.

                    If you don’t have experience with Medicare, it’s hard to match the Chinese term to the English term – and if you need to reference another website, it’s hard to tell if they are talking about the same thing you read before because multiple terms can refer to the same thing.

                    <span style="font-weight:600">Saving notes:</span> Early on in the course, the CIS5120 teaching staff pushed us to think beyond simply educating users and consider how we can tangibly help them with the next step of their Medicare journey. We re-examined the user journeys of our interviewees and noticed they often began with basic research on their own, before scheduling a meeting with an insurance agent to ask detailed questions. To support this process, we added a feature that allows users to save notes while they are going through the course and receive a PDF of their personalized questions and content to review with their insurance agent later on.

                    <span style="font-weight:600">Comprehension quizzes:</span> One of our later sources of feedback was a 70-year old UPenn professor, who recommended adding comprehension quizzes to our course for its pedagogical benefits. We noticed other education apps such as Duolingo also include small quizzes as a way to help users retain information, and we saw in testing that users seemed more motivated to read through the content carefully when they knew they would receive a quiz.

                <li>
                    <span style="font-weight:600">Paragraph-sized information bites:</span> Throughout our rounds of prototypes, we received conflicting feedback on the ideal size of our bites of information. Originally we had our content appear in bites of 1-2 sentences, similar to how Duolingo displays its long-form reading comprehension exercises, but some users found this size tedious while others found it easily digestible. To put the question to rest, we ran a controlled user study with our classmates and ultimately decided on paragraph-sized bites with questionnaires and quizzes appearing all at once.

                <li>
                    <span style="font-weight:600">General UI cleanup:</span> Along with the major feature changes above, our team was constantly re-evaluating our UI and looking for ways to make our website more minimalistic and modern. Some of the smaller changes we made include changing our color palette to be lighter, making our font all sans serif, and making sure our elements scaled based on viewport size.

                Our final working product was well received by users. Users particularly appreciated the dual language UI, which aided comprehension, alongside the bite-sized and digestible content which simplified the complexities associated with Medicare. Features including content-specific notes that are saved in a final printout, and the customized timeline were further stressed by interviewees as having potential in aiding immigrant seniors in their journeys. Overall, we were happy with the reception to MedicareCompass, which strengthened our conviction in this being a great first step in the journey of making Medicare easy and accessible for immigrant seniors.

                We recognize what we have built so far is only the beginning – tackling inequity in Medicare accessibility among immigrants is a complex problem, but we hope we were able to raise awareness of the issue through this project. We would like to send a huge thanks to the immigrant voices who helped shape this project, as well as our CIS5120 teaching staff and classmates for their generous feedback and guidance. Medicare Compass is far from complete; there is still a long list of features and content that we would have loved to build out, but did not have the time for. However, we are always keeping open the possibility of picking up this project again in the future!
